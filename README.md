"I added arrays to my Part 2 Message class in Part 3 to store all sent, stored, and ignored messages along with all message IDs and hashes. In order to display the sender/recipient list, longest message, search by ID/recipient, delete by hash, and create a sent-messages report, I then implemented search, delete, and reporting methods that use these arrays. Lastly, I developed JUnit tests using the provided test data to confirm that every array is filled in correctly and that every new method yields the desired result.
